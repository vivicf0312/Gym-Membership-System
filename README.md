# Gym-Membership-System

Designed and developed the complete backend for the gym membership system in Oracle. 
Roughly based on the 24Hour fitness model it provides ability to have a variety of membership schemes across multiple locations.
Some of the features implemented include the stored procedure for renewal process and trigger to verify and report current
membership status during user check in at any location.
